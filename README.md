# RN-CLI-CakesAccountantApp-Using-Redux
An accountant for a cake shop using Redux, Your free accountant in your hands


You do not need an accountant to calculate your profits .. With my application, you can calculate all expenses and revenues in a very easy way.

You can sell one piece and get its price, or you can make and pay for one piece
You can also sell one piece and take its profit, or sell more than one piece and take the profits

You cannot sell any piece if the stock is empty

Thanks to Redux
